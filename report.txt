I am not a java expert, its been years since I worked something in JAVA, 
But to me Programming language is just a tool for a developers imagination.
All you need to know is programming fundamentals.

    Janusgraph - In-memory stats 
    
    Total Vertices count is 3748. (Includes Airports, Countries and Continents)
    Count of Edges is 57645 (Includes Routes and Contains Relations)
    Total Load Time Excluding fetching data from CSV is: 17941 milliseconds
    Total File size is irrelevant, as it is in-memory so might be advised to consider taking it as 
java's heap memory

Not able to download decencies

B - Done
C - Done
Was able to Download normal Foundation DB from https://github.com/JanusGraph/janusgraph-foundationdb
Configured Locally and played around with it, using the same data(i.e, Air routes) using fdbcli

D - Was not able to use it is a maven Dependency, tried multiple things but nothing worked out, might require some more time 

E - Loaded the entire AirRoutes Graph, into it. Using janusgraph and foundationDB as backend in the backend but using CLI though

F - Not accurate as was not using it as maven dependency

Note: Thoroughly Enjoyed the Task
